//! Advent of Code 2021: Day 19: Beacon Scanner
//!
//! [https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19)
//!
//! This algorithm uses bloom filters to allow it to scale better. For each scanner we generate a
//! set of bits which have bits set according to the arrangement of the beacons they contain. If
//! there are two beacons with a specific offset between them, then a number of bits are guaranteed
//! to be set. Once we have this information for every scanner, we can prioritise the slower
//! matching process to pairs of scanners which share a large number of bits.
//!
//! Generating these hashes for each scanner is slow, so there is some further optimisation going
//! on as well. Firstly, we have to rotate scanners so that they will match. Instead of rotating
//! each scanner in every direction, we rotate scanners which we have placed in one set of
//! directions and the ones we haven't placed in another. We choose a set of directions in each
//! case to guarntee a match. Specifically we rotate placed scanners around the Z axis only, giving
//! four hashes for each scanner. We rotate unplaced scanners to move its Z axis into one of the
//! six other positions. since almost all scanners will first be unplaced and later placed, this
//! means we do a total of ten hashes for each scanner, instead of the twenty four we would have to
//! with a more na√Øve algorithm.
