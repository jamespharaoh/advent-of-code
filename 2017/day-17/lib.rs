//! Advent of Code 2017: Day 17: Spinlock
//!
//! [https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/17](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/17)
//!
//! # Input
//!
//! A single line containing a positive number. This is the number of positions to advance in each
//! iteration.
//!
//! # Part one
//!
//! Begin with a circular buffer containing only the number `0`. Iterate 2017 times, moving forward
//! the number of positions specified in the input, plus one, then insert the next number after the
//! current position. The answer is the number after that in the resulting buffer.
//!
//! # Part two
//!
//! Same as part one, but iterate fifty million times, and return the number following `0` in the
//! buffer.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! For part one, we use a na√Øve algorithm, creating the circular buffer and inserting the number
//! each time.
//!
//! For part two, we instead only track the number that was last inserted after zero. We model the
//! circular buffer with only the following information:
//!
//! * `size`: total number of items in the buffer
//! * `pos`: current position, where `0` is at position `0`
//! * `second`: item at position `1`, ie the answer
//!
//! Instead of iterating fifty million times, we alternate between advancing towards the end of the
//! buffer quickly using division, and advancing past the end of the buffer in a single step. This
//! allows the process to complete much more quickly.
